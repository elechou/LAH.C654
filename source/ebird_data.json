Typically keeps to cover on the ground and in mid-levels of trees but occasionally ventures into the open to feed, particularly during migration. Alert and quick to flush. Adult male has gray head, brown back, and orange belly. Females are brownish overall with more faded orange on the underparts. Breeds in eastern Siberian forests, typically in damp areas near water, or areas with dense understory. Winters in more open habitats, such as parks, but not as fond of open spaces as blackbirds. Well-spaced song phrases consist of rich warbling and ringing buzzy whistles. Also gives a high, piercing “tsssst!”",

Best distinguished by voice: a sharp, high-pitched “keek!” note, sometimes given in a series, unlike lower-pitched “tu-tu-tu” call of Short-billed. At all ages, look for subtle structural differences: Long-billed averages more hunch-backed, slightly longer-billed, and slightly taller, especially noticeable when in a mixed flock. Breeding birds have solidly salmon-orange underparts and rather dark upperparts with narrow rufous edges and white tips. Also look for sparse barring on the sides contrasting with denser spotting on the neck. Nonbreeding plumage is brownish-gray overall with a paler belly; extremely similar to Short-billed but averaging slightly darker and less patterned, especially on the breast and sides. Juveniles are easiest to identify: generally duller than Short-billed; look for plain dark-centered tertials and scapulars with narrow edging, rarely with some blurry internal markings. Breeds on tundra in high Arctic, and can be found in a variety of wetland habitats in migration and winter. Usually in flocks, feeding actively like a sewing machine. Tends to favor shallow marshy pools; somewhat more likely in freshwater habitats than Short-billed, but much overlap.",

        "identification": "A large, bulky eagle of forested hills. The small head, immensely broad wings, and large, often fanned-out tail give this bird the silhouette of a hawk on steroids when in flight. When perched, the thin upright crest separates this species from any hawk. Adults are dark brown above with thick brown bars on the belly and vertical black streaks on the throat. Juveniles are paler below, with brown upperparts showing neat pale-edge feathers and mostly pale head, lightly stippled or streaked with brown.",

Ranges from very pale gray to dark brown. Active at night, when often hunts at forest edge and around clearings in northern coniferous and mixed forests. Pairs duet; males give deep, resonating hoots and females give higher, hoarser notes. Larger and longer-tailed than Tawny Owl, which occurs mainly in milder and more southern habitats. Great Gray Owl appears longer-bodied, is more mottled, and has beady yellow eyes.",

Dark mark below each eye varies in shape and size. Juveniles are more heavily patterned below than adults, and can be quite brownish above. Patterning varies considerably across a wide global range, with back color ranging from pale gray in Central Asian “Red-capped” to slaty-blue across much of northern Eurasia North America, to almost black in Asian “Shaheen.” Chases prey down at high speeds with continuous powerful wingbeats. Becoming increasingly common in parts of range, especially in cities, where they can nest on tall buildings and feed on pigeons. Adaptable, and can be seen in a wide range of habitats; often encountered in areas with steep cliffs, as well as around coastal mudflats and open areas with shorebirds.",

Bold, often foraging out in the open on lawns and field edges, but even when hidden, its harsh chattering will give it away.",

Look for bold white wing patches in flight and red warts on the face (more extensive on males). Tends to be shy and most often seen in flight over extensive wetlands or along large rivers. Occurs extensively throughout Middle and South America, but typically scarce. Very restricted range in the U.S., only known from the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Domestic birds, on the other hand, are regularly found walking around in parks and farms, looking for scraps of food and chasing native waterfowl. Plumage varies from all white to all black, typically with more extensive red warts on the face than wild birds. There is a well-established feral population in Florida, with smaller domestic populations spread across the globe.",

In its introduced range and some areas of its native range it has interbred widely with feral and domestic chickens, producing intermediate hybrids. Many of these birds cannot be distinguished from genuine wild-type birds. Within native range calls are useful for ID: the wild male’s crowing is hoarse and choked off towards the end, unlike the loud, vibrant calls of the domestic rooster.",
